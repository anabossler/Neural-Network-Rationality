# Neural Network Rationality -- Senior Thesis (Riley Smith, LMU 2020)
All files of code related to senior thesis in economics: Neural Network Rationality.

There are many local file paths in these files that will not work unless they are updated
to the proper paths on the machine of whomever would like to run this code. The data used
in this analysis comes from Cooper and Dutcher (2011) who ran a meta-study on responder
behavior in the ultimatum game. This data will also need to obtained for the code to work
properly. Other data comes from Ho et al. (1998) who ran an experiment on p-beauty
contests but this data is included as a string in the file "formatting_bcg_data.py".

Several third party packages are also used throughout this project that must be installed
for these scripts to run properly. These packages are Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, and
Pytorch.
